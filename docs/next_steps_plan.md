# Next Steps: Complete Action Plan

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
1. **Validation**: arrayloader + modlyn ≈ H5AD + sklearn (0.916 correlation)
2. **Import fixes**: Updated to new API (arrayloaders, SimpleLogReg)
3. **Systematic debugging**: Found optimal hyperparameters
4. **Training visualization**: Added to validation notebook

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 2. Implement scVI Comparison (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: "Load 1M cells with arrayloader and apply pytorch lightning model or scvi & read_h5ad and scanpy logreg and show similar results (reproduce your barplot basically)"

**Create**: `modlyn_vs_scvi_comparison.ipynb`
```python
# Template structure:
from scvi import SCVI, LinearSCVI
from arrayloaders.io import read_lazy, ClassificationDataModule
from modlyn.models import SimpleLogReg

# 1. Load same dataset with both methods
# 2. Train LinearSCVI vs SimpleLogReg
# 3. Compare differential gene expression results
# 4. Reproduce barplot showing method comparison
```

### 3. Scale to Large Datasets (1M+ cells)
**Goal**: Use `arrayloaders.io.read_lazy` for out-of-memory data

**Key changes**:
- Switch from `SimpleLogRegDataModule` to `ClassificationDataModule`
- Use `read_lazy()` for zarr stores
- Test on larger datasets that don't fit in memory

### 4. Biological Meaningfulness Analysis
**Goal**: "If results not identical, try to show that the genes from modlyn make more sense biologically, like are they cell line specific?"

**Approach**:
- Gene set enrichment analysis
- Cell line specific marker genes
- Compare top DEGs between methods

### 5. 10M Cell Comparison
**Goal**: "Load 10M cells with arrayloader and compare results to scanpy 1M"

**Expected outcome**: Prove more useful information recovery with larger data

### 6. Task Identification
**Goal**: "What is the task we can optimize better and we would need all the data for?"

**Candidates** (since DEGs might not be appropriate):
- Foundation model pre-training
- Cross-dataset integration
- Rare cell type discovery
- Drug response prediction

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

| Task | Current Status | Target | Metric |
|------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Validation | ✅ 0.916 correlation | >0.95 | Correlation |
| scVI comparison | 🔄 Pending | Similar results | Barplot reproduction |
| Large-scale (1M) | 🔄 Pending | Memory efficient | Successful training |
| Biological validation | 🔄 Pending | Cell-line specific | Gene enrichment |
| Ultra-scale (10M) | 🔄 Pending | Better than 1M | Information recovery |

## 🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### For scVI Comparison:
```bash
pip install scvi-tools  # If not already installed
```

### For Large-scale Data:
```python
from arrayloaders.io import read_lazy, ClassificationDataModule
# Load zarr store: adata_lazy = read_lazy(store_path)
# Use ClassificationDataModule for chunked data
```

### For 10M Cells:
- Request more memory if necessary (as mentioned in your conversation)
- Consider GPU acceleration
- Monitor memory usage closely

## 📝 DELIVERABLES

1. **Notebooks**:
   - ✅ `validate_arrayloader_equivalence.ipynb`
   - 🔄 `modlyn_vs_scvi_comparison.ipynb`
   - 🔄 `large_scale_analysis.ipynb` (1M+ cells)
   - 🔄 `ultra_scale_analysis.ipynb` (10M cells)

2. **Analysis Results**:
   - Method comparison barplots
   - Biological significance analysis
   - Scaling performance metrics
   - Task optimization recommendations

3. **Final Paper**: "Write the paper!"

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Start with scVI comparison** - this builds directly on your validation success and addresses the "reproduce your barplot" requirement from your original plan.

**Data loaders comparison will be done by Felix and Ilan** (as noted), so you can focus on the model comparisons and biological analysis.
